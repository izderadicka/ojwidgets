(** Something that behave like a button, with press, unpress and switch action.
    If [pressed] is true (default false) the button is pressed by default.
    If [button] is present (with some DOM element), this element will be used
    as a button: click on it will trigger actions open or close alternatively.
    If [set] is present, the button will act like a radio button: only one
    with the same set can be opened at the same time.
    Call function [new_set] to create a new set.
    If [closeable_by_button] is false, then the button will open but not close.
    If [closeable_by_method] is false, then the unpress method will have no effect.
    If both are false, the only way to unpress is
    to press another one belonging to the same set.

    Redefine [on_press] and [on_unpress] for your needs.

    Redefine [on_pre_press] [on_post_press] [on_pre_unpress] or [on_post_unpress]
    if you want something to happen just before or after pressing/unpressing.
