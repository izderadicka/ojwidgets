(** Buttons may belong to a [button_set]. A set will close the last opened
  * button if another one is going to be opened (actually, like radio button).
  * There are four callbacks to define which correspond to the different steps
  * of a button swap.
  * [on_first] will be called when there is no button pressed
  * [on_same] will be called when the same button is pressed again
  * [on_open] will be called when a new button is pressed
  * [on_close] will bew called when a button is unpressed
  *)
