(** Type used mainly to describe where the dragger should scroll to.
        `Bottom and `Top are for vertical scrollbar, `Left and `Right for
        horizontal. *)
type scroll_t =
  | Bottom
  | First
  | Int of int
  | Last

  | Top

(** This function add a custom scrollbar to the element elt. There are
    several optionnal callbacks that you can add at construction, but you can
    also add them later.

    @param height determines the height of the scrollbar. If none, the
    scrollbar will have the size of the element.

    @param scroll determines the starting position of the dragger. The dragger
    will actually be positionned

    @param inertia : scrolling inertia in milliseconds. Really low
    values (<10) are forced to 10, because it breaks the scrollbar when
    under 10. Low values are irrelevant anyway, since the user can't
    even see it. To disable the inertia, put 0.

    @param mouse_wheel_pixels : Mouse wheel scrolling amount in pixel. If
    undefined , the value "auto" is used. *)

(** Returns the position of the dragger. The position is updated only
    when the dragger has finished its movement. Thus, if you call it while the
    dragger is moving, the position returned will be the position of the
    dragger before the scroll *)

    get_dragger_pos, the position is only updated when the dragger has
    finished its movement. *)

(** lwt_scroll_to , as its name suggests, scrolls the scrollbar bound
    to elt to a point defined by scroll ([ `Bottom | `First | `Int of int |
    |`Last | `Left | `Right | `Top ]). It returns a thread which end when
    the scrolling is done (immadiately if inertia is desactivated).*)
val lwt_scroll_to : ?inertia:bool -> ?scroll:scroll_t  ->
  #Dom_html.element Js.t -> unit Lwt.t

(** Update the scrollbar. You should call this function each time the content of the element the scrollbar is attached to is changed. *)
val update : ?height:(Dom_html.element Js.t -> int) ->
  ?scroll:scroll_t -> Dom_html.element Js.t -> unit Lwt.t

(** Adds a function to the list of function to do when a scroll
    is required, and before it is actually done. *)
val scroll_starts : (unit -> unit) -> #Dom_html.element Js.t -> 'a Lwt.t

(** Adds a function to the list of function to do after
    a scroll. *)
